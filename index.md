# <a name="description">Objectives</a>

 Fundamentals of Electrical Engineering is an integrated course intended to enhance the knowledge of students in electric circuits, DC and AC machines and develop analytical skills. The course addresses the underlying concepts and methods behind Electrical Engineering. The course presents the knowledge of the Fundamentals of Electrical Engineering, basic principles, types of electrical circuit and network theorems. The principle and operating conditions of D.C. Machines (Motor and Generator), Transformers, Induction Motors and alternators will be discussed.

## <a name="outcomes">Course Outcomes</a>

After the completion of the course, the student will be able to:

A7204.1 Apply network reduction techniques and knowledge of alternating quantities to calculate current, Voltage and Power for complex circuits.

A7204.2 Analyze the electrical circuits using Nodal Analysis, Mesh Analysis and Network Theorems.

A7204.3 Analyze the characteristics of DC machines, AC Machines and 1-Phase Transformers.

A7204.4 Test the performance of DC Machines, 1-Phase Transformers and AC Machines.

# Coursework

Inform the instructor any time *prior* to the due date for an assignment that you wish to use a late day; you may then turn in the assignment up to 24
hours late. Multiple late days may be used on the same assignment. There are no partial late days; turning in an assignment 2 hours late or 20 hours late will
both use 1 late day. Note that late days are intended to cover both normal circumstances (you simply want more time to work on the assignment) and exceptional circumstances. The late assignments will receive at most half credit.
